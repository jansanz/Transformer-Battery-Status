Transformer Battery Status app
==============================

[Asus Eee Pad Transformer][1] battery status app. It displays both the tablet battery level 
as well as the dock battery level. This is **an app, not a widget** so it doest not tax the battery at all.

For easy access, add the icon to the home screen.

To dismiss the app, simply tap outside the window of the app, or use any of the status bar buttons (back, home ...).

Available in two themes:

* Holo
* Holo.Light
